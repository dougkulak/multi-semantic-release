This fork of [dhoub/multi-semantic-release](https://github.com/dhoulb/multi-semantic-release) replaces [`setImmediate` loops](https://github.com/dhoulb/multi-semantic-release/blob/561a8e66133d422d88008c32c479d1148876aba4/lib/wait.js#L13)
and [`execa.sync` hooks](https://github.com/dhoulb/multi-semantic-release/blob/561a8e66133d422d88008c32c479d1148876aba4/lib/execaHook.js#L5) with event-driven flow and finally makes possible to run the most release operations in parallel.

## Install

```sh
yarn add @dougkulak/multi-semantic-release --dev
```

## Usage

```sh
multi-semantic-release
```

CLI flag options:

```sh
  Options
    --dry-run Dry run mode.
    --debug Output debugging information.
    --sequential-init  Avoid hypothetical concurrent initialization collisions.
    --first-parent Apply commit filtering to current branch only.
	--ignore-packages  Packages list to be ignored on bumping process (append to the ones that already exist at package.json workspaces)
    --deps.bump Define deps version updating rule. Allowed: override, satisfy, inherit.
		--deps.release Define release type for dependent package if any of its deps changes. Supported values: patch, minor, major, inherit.
    --help Help info.

  Examples
    $ multi-semantic-release --debug
	$ multi-semantic-release --deps.bump=satisfy --deps.release=patch
	$ multi-semantic-release --ignore-packages=packages/a/**,packages/b/**
```

## Configuration
**MSR** requires **semrel** config to be added [in any supported format](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration) for each package or/and declared in repo root (`globalConfig` is extremely useful if all the modules have the same strategy of release).  
NOTE config resolver joins `globalConfig` and `packageConfig` during execution.
```javascript
// Load the package-specific options.
const { options: pkgOptions } = await getConfig(dir);

// The 'final options' are the global options merged with package-specific options.
// We merge this ourselves because package-specific options can override global options.
const finalOptions = Object.assign({}, globalOptions, pkgOptions);
```

Make sure to have a `workspaces` attribute inside your `package.json` project file. In there, you can set a list of packages that you might want to process in the msr process, as well as ignore others. For example, let's say your project has 4 packages (i.e. a, b, c and d) and you want to process only a and d (ignore b and c). You can set the following structure in your `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"name": "msr-test-yarn",
	"author": "Doug Kulak <dougkulak@gmail.com>",
	"version": "0.0.0-semantically-released",
	"private": true,
	"license": "MIT",
	"engines": {
		"node": ">=8.3"
	},
	"workspaces": [
      "packages/*",
      "!packages/b/**",
      "!packages/c/**"
	],
	"release": {
		"plugins": [
			"@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
			"@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
		],
		"noCi": true
	}
}
```

You can also ignore it with the CLI:

```bash
$ multi-semantic-release --ignore-packages=packages/b/**,packages/c/**
```

You can also combine the CLI ignore options with the `!` operator at each package inside `workspaces` attribute. Even though you can use the CLI to ignore options, you can't use it to set which packages to be released â€“ i.e. you still need to set the `workspaces` attribute inside the `package.json`.
